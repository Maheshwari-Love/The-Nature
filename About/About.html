          <p>
            Plitviče Lakes National Park is a 295-sq.-km forest reserve in central
            Croatia. It's known for a chain of 16 terraced lakes, joined by
            waterfalls, that extend into a limestone canyon. Walkways and hiking
            trails wind around and across the water, and an electric boat links
            the 12 upper and 4 lower lakes. The latter are the site of Veliki
            Slap, a 78m-high waterfall.
